    "Python is used for a wide variety of tasks including back-end web development, scripting, data science,data analysis, machine learning. Start-ups also like to implement python because of it’s easy to use and scalable. One of the main advantages of python is that it was designed to emphasise code readability. Python is used by Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, NASA, YouTube, Dropbox, Instagram and Quora and many more.\n",
